# ❤️‍🔥 LOVE Protocol

**The Inverse Market Engine for Future Improvement**

## Overview

LOVE Protocol is a decentralized impact measurement system that detects relational system failures before traditional markets can price them. By coordinating human micro-interventions that prevent negative futures, LOVE mints non-transferable units of value proportional to validated future improvement.

## Documentation

### Core Protocol

- **[White Paper v1.0](./LOVE_PROTOCOL_WHITEPAPER_V1.md)**: Complete protocol specification, architecture, and economic model
- **[Implementation Plan](./IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)**: Local-first experimental substrate plan with mutations, phases, and success metrics

### Specifications

- **[YES Pen Spec](./specs/YES_PEN_SPEC.md)**: Moment-Key Cryptography for multi-person presence-based encryption
- **[LOVE Note Spec](./specs/LOVE_NOTE_SPEC.md)**: Human-readable receipt format for validated interventions
- **[Specs Overview](./specs/README.md)**: Complete specifications directory guide

## Key Concepts

- **Inverse Alpha**: Detecting system failures faster than markets can price them
- **Human Triangulation Consensus (HTC)**: Three-witness validation system
- **ΔF Score**: Multi-dimensional scoring for intervention impact
- **Inverse Market Index (IMI)**: Aggregated predictive signals from LOVE mints
- **Non-Transferable Value**: LOVE represents impact, not speculation

## Protocol Layers

1. **Data Ingestion Layer**: Captures intervention inputs
2. **Validation & Consensus Layer**: Human triangulation ensures authenticity
3. **Scoring & Minting Layer**: Calculates LOVE issuance
4. **Inverse Market Index Layer**: Generates predictive signals
5. **Output Layer**: Guides stewards and enables markets

## Status

**Current Version**: v1.0 (White Paper + Implementation Plan)

**Development Status**: 
- ✅ Protocol specification complete
- ✅ Implementation plan defined (local-first experimental substrate)
- ✅ Phase 0: Lab Environment - **READY TO RUN**
  - AI simulation framework with Ollama
  - Baseline scenarios for testing
  - Protocol logic implementation
  - Measurement and analysis tools

## Core Hypothesis

**Subjective consensus + embedding geometry can detect relational gradients faster than traditional metrics.**

LOVE Protocol is not a finished product but a **mutable experimental substrate** for communities to build their own impact accounting systems. Success is measured by whether mutations survive and predict real-world events.
